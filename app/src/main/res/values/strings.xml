    <string name="thisAppText">This is a fan-made app dedicated to assist fellow townies in-game as well as serve as a reference manual. It features an intuitive role tracker for classic and ranked modes that helps make it easier for players to determine the remaining roles, which can be useful for any role in the game! The reference provided is very useful for dealing with meta-gaming jailors (you know who you are) as well as for increasing your general game knowledge. Future updates will include a role tracker for other game modes, additional reference material such as strategies and achievements, and changes according to new patches. Don\'t forget to leave a review to let me know what you\'d like to see next! From one townie to another, thank you for downloading this app. And in Ranked Practice, I go by ChocMilkJr, so feel free to let me know what you think about this app =).</string>
    <string name="gameDescriptionText">Town of Salem is a browser-based game that challenges players on their ability to convincingly lie as well as detect when other players are lying. The game ranges from 7 to 15 players. These players are randomly divided into alignments - Town, Mafia, and Neutrals. If you are a Town member (the good guys) you must track down the Mafia and other villains before they kill you. The catch? You don\'t know who is a Town member and who is a villain. If you are an evil role, such as a Serial Killer, you secretly murder town members in the veil of night and try to avoid getting caught. (Summary provided by BlankMediaGames)</string>
